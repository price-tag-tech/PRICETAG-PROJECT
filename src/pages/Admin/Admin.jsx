      <p>Please maintain (#222325) it is our primary color, dont use the green color ok, maintain this blakc color code especially in you button background 
        and border, check the index.css i have listed all the custume btn colors and radius to be used, please maintain a steady design, also study the 
        landing page and see how i arranged it and did the routing. Please the routing in the App.jsx is the global routing try as much as posible to be very careful while doing anything there.
        before you do do anything on the App.jsx tell me first, am always here to guide you, so always ask me questions incase you dont understand some things
        especially the routing aspect. Also dont add any loader or loading animation, later we can figure that out togeter, no much asnimations ok. 
        Also check the landing page - Components - Navbar, you wil see the icons we will be using in this project
        (@heroicons and @tabular icons). If you dont understand anything always ask me. Dont make heavy installations ok. Always tell me before making any installations.
